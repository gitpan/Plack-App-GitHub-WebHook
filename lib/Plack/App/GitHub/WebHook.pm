=head1 NAME

Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook - GitHub WebHook receiver as Plack application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Basic usage

    use Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook;

    Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook->new(
        hook => sub {
            my $payload = shift;
            ...
        }
    )->to_app;

=head2 Multiple task hooks

A hook can consist of multiple tasks, given by an array reference. The tasks
are called one by one until a task returns a false value.

    use Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook;
    use IPC::Run3;

    Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook->new(
        hook => [
            sub { $_[0]->{repository}{name} eq 'foo' }, # filter
            { Filter => { repository_name => 'foo' } }, # equivalent filter
            sub { my ($payload) = @_; ...  }, # some action
            sub { run3 \@cmd ... }, # some more action
        ]
    )->to_app;

=head2 Access restriction    

By default access is restricted to known GitHub WebHook IPs.

    Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook->new(
        hook => sub { ... },
        access => [
            allow => "204.232.175.64/27",
            allow => "192.30.252.0/22",
            deny  => 'all'
        ]
    )->to_app;

    # this is equivalent to
    use Plack::Builder;
    builder {
        mount 'notify' => builder {
            enable 'Access', rules => [
                allow => "204.232.175.64/27",
                allow => "192.30.252.0/22",
                deny  => 'all'
            ]
            Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook->new(
                hook => sub { ... }
            );
        }
    };

=head2 Synchronize with a GitHub repository

The following application automatically pulls the master branch of a GitHub
repository into a local working directory C<$work_tree>.

    use Git::Repository
    use Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook;

    Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook->new(
        events => ['pull'],
        safe => 1,
        hook => [
            sub { $_[0]->{ref} eq 'refs/heads/master' },
            sub {
                if ( -d "$work_tree/.git") {
                    Git::Repository->new( work_tree => $work_tree )
                                   ->run(qw(pull origin master));
                } else {
                    my $origin = $_[0]->{repository}->{clone_url};
                    Git::Repository->run( 'clone', $origin, $work_tree );
                }
                1;
            },
            # sub { ...optional action after each pull... } 
        ],
    )->to_app;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<PSGI> application receives HTTP POST requests with body parameter
C<payload> set to a JSON object. The default use case is to receive 
L<GitHub WebHooks|http://developer.github.com/webhooks/>, for instance
L<PushEvents|http://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent>.

The response of a HTTP request to this application is one of:

=over 4

=item HTTP 403 Forbidden

If access was not granted (for instance because it did not origin from GitHub).

=item HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed

If the request was no HTTP POST.

=item HTTP 400 Bad Request

If the payload was no well-formed JSON or the C<X-GitHub-Event> header did not
match configured events.

=item HTTP 200 OK

Otherwise, if the hook was called and returned a true value.

=item HTTP 202 Accepted

Otherwise, if the hook was called and returned a false value.

=back

This module requires at least Perl 5.10.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item hook

A code reference or an array of code references with tasks that are executed on
an incoming webhook.  Each task gets passed the encoded payload. If the task
returns a true value, next the task is called or HTTP status code 200 is
returned. Information can be passed from one task to the next by modifying the
payload. 

If a task returns a false value or if no task was given, HTTP status code 202
is returned immediately. This mechanism can be used for conditional hooks or to
detect hooks that were called successfully but failed to execute for some
reason.

=item safe

Wrap all hook tasks in C<< eval { ... } >> blocks to catch exceptions. A dying
task in safe mode is equivalent to a task that returns a false value.

=item access

Access restrictions, as passed to L<Plack::Middleware::Access>. See SYNOPSIS
for the default value. A recent list of official GitHub WebHook IPs is vailable
at L<https://api.github.com/meta>. One should only set the access value on
instantiation, or manually call C<prepare_app> after modification.

=item events

A list of L<event types|http://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/>
expected to be send with the C<X-GitHub-Event> header (e.g. C<['pull']>).

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item

GitHub WebHooks are documented at L<http://developer.github.com/webhooks/>.

=item

L<WWW::GitHub::PostReceiveHook> uses L<Web::Simple> to receive GitHub web
hooks. A listener as exemplified by the module can also be created like this:

    use Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook;
    use Plack::Builder;
    build {
        mount '/myProject' => 
            Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook->new(
                hook => sub { my $payload = shift; }
            );
        mount '/myOtherProject' => 
            Plack::App::GitHub::WebHook->new(
                hook => sub { run3 \@cmd ... }
            );
    };

=item

L<Net::GitHub> and L<Pithub> provide access to GitHub APIs.

=item

L<App::GitHubWebhooks2Ikachan> is an application that also receives GitHub WebHooks.
